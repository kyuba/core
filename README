###- QUICK AND DIRTY: COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION -############################
  You'll need curie-8, including icemake, and duat-6...

    $ icemake -dif /usr


################################################################################


NOTE:
  This is an early version of this programme and it doesn't have nearly as many
  of the features we're having in mind for the final version. Right now it's
  just a sysvinit clone using 9p and a configuration file in s-expressions.
  In essence, you'll still need some sort of "rc system", which distributions
  tend to ship with. If you're doing an LFS or similar, right now I'd recommend
  using OpenRC ( http://roy.marples.name/projects/openrc ) with kyuba.

NOTE.2:
  Please take note of the programme licence (the COPYING file), as well as the
  credits (the CREDITS file).


###- DETAILS -##################################################################

Compilation:
  Make sure you have libcurie-8 and libduat-6 installed, then:

    $ icemake

  A number of compilation options are available if you run into issues. To see
  them, use:

    $ icemake --help

Installation:
  use this command to install regularly (for example into /, in the example):

    $ icemake -dif /

  NOTE that this will include some header files which you may not want to keep,
  as well as shared and static libraries which may not be necessary. In
  particular that will be /lib/libkyuba* and /include/kyuba/. Also you may wish
  to move the docs from /share to /usr/share.

  If you're on gentoo, the ebuilds on the jyujin overlay will do this for you,
  so just use those instead of installing things manually.

Configuration:
  Check out /etc/kyu/init.sx, which comes preconfigured for use with openrc.
  Proper documentation will follow in a later version, but the file itself
  should be more or less self-documenting.

  The file format is plain S-expressions, as used in lisp dialects. The
  semi-colon (;) character may be used to introduce comments; they start at that
  character and extend to the end of the line.

CONTACT:
  Best bet is IRC: freenode #kyuba
