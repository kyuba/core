###- QUICK AND DIRTY: COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION -############################
  You'll need curie-7, including icemake, and duat-5...

    $ icemake -dif /usr

NOTE:
  This is an early version of this programme and it doesn't have nearly as many
  of the features we're having in mind for the final version. Right now it's
  just a sysvinit clone using 9p and a configuration file in s-expressions.
  In essence, you'll still need some sort of "rc system", which distributions
  tend to ship with. If you're doing an LFS or similar, right now I'd recommend
  using OpenRC ( http://roy.marples.name/projects/openrc ) with kyuba.

NOTE.2:
  Please take note of the library licence (the COPYING file), as well as the
  credits (the CREDITS file).
